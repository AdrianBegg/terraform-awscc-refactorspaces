## Costs and licenses

You pay for the cost of the Refactor Spaces feature and and any resources being consumed on AWS. For more information, refer to [AWS Migration Hub pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/pricing/).

## Architecture

The module can be used to create all AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces components as part of a single deployment or to add AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces applications or services to an existing AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces environment or application (for example in multi-account deployment scenarios).

Figure 1 shows an example deploying all AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces in a single account.

Figure 1. Example configuration of AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces deployed with a monolithic application 'Unishop' with a new AddToCart microservice running as a Lambda microservice.

As shown in the diagram, the module in this example sets up the following:

- An AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces environment with the *Provision a network bridge for cross account connectivity* option configured which creates a new AWS Transit Gateway
- An AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces application which creates an Amazon API Gateway and establishes a VPC Private Link to a provided Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- The following AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces services:
  - *Default* pointing to a monolithic application deployed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), or similar services. This service is acting as the default route for traffic.
  - *AddToCart* pointing at a microservice deployed as a Lambda Function *AddToCart* which holds the modernized AddToCart business logic.
  - A route that sends requests for the *AddToCart* domain to the Lambda function.

## Known Issues

### Vpc Association Failed for Vpc with ID vpc-XXXYYYZZZ to environment with ID env-XXXYYYXZZ

**Issue:** During a `terraform apply` throw the following when deploying a the module with two (or more) AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces Applications defined (see below for example) the following exception is thrown:

```log
Error: AWS SDK Go Service Operation Incomplete
│
│   with module.refactor_spaces_application["XXXX"].awscc_refactorspaces_application.current,
│   on modules\tf-refactor-spaces-application\main.tf line 13, in resource "awscc_refactorspaces_application" "current":
│   13: resource "awscc_refactorspaces_application" "current" {
│
│ Waiting for Cloud Control API service CreateResource operation completion returned: waiter state transitioned to FAILED. StatusMessage: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Resource of type AWS::RefactorSpaces::Application with identifier app-XXXXX did not stabilize. Details = ErrorResponse(AccountId=XXXXXXX, Code=RESOURCE_CREATION_FAILURE, Message=Vpc Association Failed for Vpc with ID vpc-XXXYYYZZZ to environment with ID env-XXXYYYXZZ., ResourceIdentifier=vpc-XXXYYYZZZ, ResourceType=VPC). ErrorCode: InternalFailure
```

Example configuration:

```hcl
module "refactor_spaces" {
  source  = "aws-ia/refactorspaces/awscc"
  version = "1.0.0"

  environment_name        = "Unicorn"
  environment_description = "AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces environment for Unicorn Rentals."
  provision_network_bridge = true
  applications = [
    {
      application_name         = "Unistore"
      proxy_type               = "REGIONAL"
      application_proxy_vpc_id = "vpc-AAABBBBCCC"
      apigateway_stage_name    = "prod"
    },
    {
      application_name         = "Birds"
      proxy_type               = "REGIONAL"
      application_proxy_vpc_id = "vpc-DDDEEEFFF"
      apigateway_stage_name    = "prod"
    }
  ]
```

**Cause** This condition is caused as terraform attempts to create both Refactor Spaces Applications in asynchronously however concurrent creation/deletion of Application within the same AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces environment is not supported.

**Workaround** Use the terraform [`-parallelism`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply#parallelism-n) flag set to `1` during the apply (e.g. `terraform apply -parallelism=1`) if creating multiple applications during a single apply or create the first application and perform the `terraform apply` and upon successful execution add the next application and re-run `terraform apply`.

### Services forced recreation during every apply when using `awscc_refactorspaces_environment` or `awscc_refactorspaces_application` data objects in module input variables

**Issue:** When using the module to create AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces Services & Routes as separate module blocks and using the using the `awscc_refactorspaces_environment` or `awscc_refactorspaces_application` data objects as inputs terraform will create force re-creation (delete, create) during every apply.

**Cause** This is because the attributes `application_identifier` and `environment_identifier` will be marked as `(known after apply)` for the service and route resources which will force a replacement as these attributes are marked in the provider as a forced replacement operation.

**Workaround** Use input variables to define the values passed as `environment_id` and `application_id` to the module to prevent this behavior.

### Defining multiple module blocks in the same HCL throws `Error: Invalid count argument`

**Issue:** When using the module to create AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces components as separate module blocks (e.g. one module block to create the environment, one module block to create an application and one module block to create services) in the same HCL which references the dependent module blocks, terraform throws:

```log
 Error: Invalid count argument

   on .terraform\modules\XXXX\main.tf line 6, in module "XXX":
    6:   count = local.create_environment ? 1 : 0

The "count" value depends on resource attributes that cannot be determined until apply, so Terraform cannot predict how many instances will be created. To work around this, use the -target argument to first apply only the resources that the count depends on.
```

**Cause** The module uses count/foreach blocks to determine if an environment or application needs to be created. During a terraform plan, as the `environment_id` and/or `application_id` values are not known until after the apply, terraform throws an exception. Terraform currently has a limitation when using computed values in modules containing count and foreach blocks as the number of objects created must be known before the apply. (See <https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26078>).

**Workaround** There are several approaches to workaround this issue such as:

  1. If you wish to define multiple module blocks in a single HCL definition, use `terraform apply -target=module.XXX` to create the dependent modules first before calling `terraform apply`. You may have to execute several different `apply` actions with this approach or;
  2. Deploy each module blocks in different pipelines/projects/folders and read the remote state or use the relevant data objects to read the inputs

### In a multi-account deployment, service creation/deletion fails with Route Table operation failures if service tags removed from objects

**Issue:** In a multi-account deployment, service creation/deletion fails with a message similar to:

```log
Waiting for Cloud Control API service CreateResource operation completion returned: waiter state transitioned to FAILED. StatusMessage: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Resource of type AWS::RefactorSpaces::Service
│ with identifier svc-XXXX did not stabilize. Details = ErrorResponse(AccountId=XXXX, AdditionalDetails={TransitGatewayID=tgw-XXXXX, DestinationCIDRBlock=XX.XX.XX.0/XX,
│ RouteTableID=rtb-XXXX}, Code=RESOURCE_UPDATE_FAILURE, Message=Failed to update Route table rtb-XXXXX to add route from CIDR XX.XX.XX.0/XX to TGW tgw-XXXX,
│ ResourceIdentifier=rtb-XXXXX, ResourceType=ROUTE_TABLE). ErrorCode: InternalFailure
```

**Cause** AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service creates two tags `refactor-spaces:environment-id` and `refactor-spaces:application-id` on resources that are part of an environment during configuration. The table below provides a list of where each tag is configured as part of the service configuration.

These tags are used by the service and removal/adjustment can cause the service to behave incorrectly. In a multi-account deployment if these tags are removed from the resources this will cause the AWS Migration Services Refactor Spaces service operations to not complete successfully. This can occur if the objects are managed by AWS Config or Terraform with a configuration to have tags set explicitly to a set of values.

| Resource                                        | Tag(s)                         | Value                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Environment Transit Gateway                     | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Environment Resource Share                      | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Application Amazon API Gateway                  | refactor-spaces:application-id | Refactor Spaces Application Id   |
| Network Load Balancer                           | refactor-spaces:application-id | Refactor Spaces Application Id   |
| Application Proxy VPC                           | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Application Proxy VPC Subnet(s)                 | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Application Proxy VPC Route Table(s)            | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Application Proxy VPC Endpoint Service          | refactor-spaces:application-id | Refactor Spaces Application Id   |
| Application Proxy Refactor Spaces Security Group| refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Service Endpoint VPC                            | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Service Endpoint VPC Subnet(s)                  | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Service Endpoint VPC Route Table(s)             | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Service Endpoint Transit GW Attachment          | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |
| Service Endpoint Refactor Spaces Security Group | refactor-spaces:environment-id | Refactor Spaces Environment Id   |

**Workaround** Any of these resources managed by Terraform (including those imported) should include these tags as part of the terraform resource definition or explicitly ignore them during applies.

For resources using the `aws` provider you can add the following to the provider configuration:

```hcl
  ignore_tags {
    key_prefixes = ["refactor-spaces:"]
  }
```

For resources managed by the `awscc` provider you must add the tags to the resource definitions. A [feature request](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-awscc/issues/800) has been opened to add this feature to the `awscc` provider in the future.
