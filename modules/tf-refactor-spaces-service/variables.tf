  (Optional) Collection of AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service routes to associate with the service. Required if `default_route = false`.

  Properties:
    - `source_path`         = (Required|string) The path to use to match traffic. Paths must start with / and are relative to the base of the application. If the route is the default this should be set as '/'.
    - `include_child_paths` = (Optional|bool) Indicates whether to match all subpaths of the given source path. If this value is `false`, requests must match the source path exactly before they are forwarded to this route's service. Default true.
    - `http_verbs`          = (Optional|list(string)) A list of HTTP methods to match. An empty list matches all values. Default all values.
    - `route_active`        = (Required|bool) If set to `true`, traffic is forwarded to this routeâ€™s service after the route is created.

  Default Route Example:
  ```
  routes = [
    {
      source_path = "/"
      route_active = true
    }
  ]
  ```
  Non-default route examples:
  ```
  routes = [
    {
        source_path         = "/unicorns/basket"
        include_child_paths = true
        http_verbs          = ["POST","GET"]
        route_active        = true
    }
  ]
  ```

    source_path         = string

    route_active        = bool
