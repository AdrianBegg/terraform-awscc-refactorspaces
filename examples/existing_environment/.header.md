# Example: Deploy a microservice to an existing shared application

The following example creates a new AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service based on an AWS Lambda function and a route for `GET` and `POST` methods to the path `/unicorns/reviews`, in an existing AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces application deployed in or shared with the executing AWS account. The use case for this example is to deploy the environment and application in separate CI/CD pipelines and deploy the service as part of the microservice CI/CD pipeline in a separate account.

This example sets up the following:

* An AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service (*Unistore-AddReview*) pointing at a microservice deployed as a Lambda function with the ARN `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:AddReview`. This service is in an existing AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces application shared with the account with the ID `app-xy1ABCDE1a`, in the environment `env-ab9ZXYVT9z`.
* A route that sends `POST` and `GET` requests to `/unicorns/reviews` to the Lambda function.
